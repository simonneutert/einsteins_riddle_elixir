# Solving Einstein's Riddle with Elixir
Sean Handley has solved Einstein's riddle in a remarkable way using Ruby. I stand on his shoulderes and forced his code through Elixir.

Please checkout out his amazing blog post on Medium: [Sean Handley: Solving Einsteinâ€™s Riddle with Ruby](https://medium.com/@sean.handley/solving-einstein-s-riddle-with-ruby-e78ba9ebabe) and/or the corresponding [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/seanhandley/einstein)

# How to run
